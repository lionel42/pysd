Bugs during translation
-----------------------
1. Check the line where it happened and try to identify if it is due to a missing function or feature or for any other reason.
2. See if there is any opened issue with the same of similar bug. If it is you can add there your specific problem.
3. If there is no similar issue, open a new one. Try to use a descriptive title such us `Missing subscripts support for Xmile models`, avoid titles like `Error when parsing Xmile model`. Provide the given error information, and if possible, a small model reproducing the same error.
