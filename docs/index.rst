This project is a simple library for running System Dynamics models in python, with the purpose of
improving integration of Big Data and Machine Learning into the SD workflow.

PySD translates :doc:`Vensim <development/vensim_translation>` or
:doc:`XMILE <development/xmile_translation>` model files into python modules,
and provides methods to modify, simulate, and observe those translated models.

PySD Cookbook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A cookbook of simple recipes for advanced data analytics using PySD is available at:
http://pysd-cookbook.readthedocs.org/

The cookbook includes models, sample data, and code in the form of ipython notebooks that demonstrate a variety of data integration and analysis tasks. These models can be executed on your local machine, and modified to suit your particular analysis requirements.


Contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The code for this package is available at: https://github.com/JamesPHoughton/pysd

If you find a bug, or are interested in a particular feature, see :doc:`reporting bugs <../reporting_bugs>`.

If you are interested in contributing to the development of PySD, see the :doc:`developer documentation <../development/development_index>`
listed above.

Citing
^^^^^^
If you use PySD in any published work, consider citing the `PySD Introductory Paper <https://github.com/JamesPHoughton/pysd/blob/master/docs/PySD%20Intro%20Paper%20Preprint.pdf>`_::

   Houghton, James; Siegel, Michael. "Advanced data analytics for system dynamics models using PySD." *Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference of the System Dynamics Society.* 2015.

You can also cite the library using the `DOI provided by Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5654824>`_. It is recomendable to specify the used PySD version and its correspondent DOI. If you want to cite all versions you can use the generic DOI for PySD instead:
